// export const aboutMe = `I have been working in a web and software development company for over six years now, starting as a software developer in Makati, Philippines. After a year, I went to Qatar and worked for five years, where I had the opportunity to work in various roles such as a System Administrator, Graphic/Web Developer, Junior Business Analyst, and Graphic/Web Developer for four different companies. Whenever I come across a beautiful website or web-based system, I am always curious about how they design and develop the system or website. When the pandemic hit, I decided to return to the Philippines and asked for relocation, which allowed me to work remotely. During this time, I took advantage of my experience in designing websites and developing systems by enrolling in a MERN stack development course on Udemy. Since then, I have created a website, a web-based accounting system, and an HR system. I am now excited to apply for my next opportunity in the industry. `
